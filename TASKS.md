For carrying out the industry analysis we are going to cover several topics such as the market size, market forecast, companyâ€™s profit and number of employees. In fact, it is important to clarify that the United States is the country leading this industry. Thus, most of the information is going to be related to the aforementioned country. 

According to what is mentioned in the market research report of IBISworld about the Medical Instrument & Supply Manufacturing Industry in the US, the market size ranges around $84billions a quite significant amount. Indeed, the market size has been increasing at a considerable rate over the last 6 years. Undoubtedly, it is important to mention that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered unprecedented increased demand for some medical devices.  Regarding the Porter analysis and important opportunity for this industry is the fact that the population is aging. This demographic factor  may have a  significant effect on demand for medical supplies and instruments, as their need for care drives increases in overall public and private health expenditure. In contrast, possible constraints to industry growth may come in the form of reduced hospital capital equipment spending amid tight credit market conditions, stressed government budgets and soft demand for elective medical procedures. As mentioned on the NAICS  website the total Marketable US Businesses are 4470 which represents a  % of overall.

* List of your company's primary activities divided into engineering activities and operations activities:

**Engineering:** engineers must gain an understanding of all the issues surrounding the particular design of creating protesis. It includes activities intense in cognitive non-routine tasks. Indeed, the primary activity of engineers is related to carry out all the task previous to apply Additive manufacturign (AM). In other words, all the task related with technology development such as R&D, product design, process development and prototyping . It is very important to develop, try and analyze some different prototypes before designing and producing the definitive prosthesis.

**Operations activities:** it comprises all routine and manual tasks. For example, it includes setting up tools, machines, handling inventory, assembling products, fixing, brazing, manufacturing lead products, heat materials, producing advanced composite materials and so on.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators.
