## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities
***
For carrying out the industry analysis we are going to cover several topics such as the market size, market forecast, company’s profit and number of employees. In fact, it is important to clarify that the United States is the country leading this industry. Thus, most of the information is going to be related to the aforementioned country. 

According to what is mentioned in the market research report of IBISworld about the Medical Instrument & Supply Manufacturing Industry in the US, the market size ranges around $84billions a quite significant amount. Indeed, the market size has been increasing at a considerable rate over the last 6 years. Undoubtedly, it is important to mention that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered unprecedented increased demand for some medical devices.  Regarding the Porter analysis and important opportunity for this industry is the fact that the population is aging. This demographic factor  may have a  significant effect on demand for medical supplies and instruments, as their need for care drives increases in overall public and private health expenditure. In contrast, possible constraints to industry growth may come in the form of reduced hospital capital equipment spending amid tight credit market conditions, stressed government budgets and soft demand for elective medical procedures. As mentioned on the NAICS  website the total Marketable US Businesses are 4470 which represents a  % of overall.

## Task 3
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.

For computing the number of available workers the formula that we have followed is as follows a=MD^-1b. Indeed, M stands for the movement of workers having in the diagonal workers that remain in the same occupation being 5 managers, 10 operators and 45 eningeers. With respect to the diagonal matrix it stands for the number of workers at the beggining of the previous year. In fact, given that the company is new the historical data used is the industry average. Moreover, nowadays there are 2 managers, 1 operator and 1 engineer.  Finally, after carrying out computations using the python software it has been determined that the number of availabe workers needed are 1 manager, 1 operator and 1 engineer in a year from now. 
***

## Task 4
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

For computing the number of workers demanded the formula that we have followed is as follows 𝑦𝑖𝑡=𝛽̂𝑥𝑡+𝛿̂1𝑜1+𝛿̂2𝑜2+ 𝛿̂3𝑜3. Indeed, the first column of xt shows historical data on unemployment of the industry average which was 15%,17% and 14% for managers,23%, 27%, and 25% for operators and 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers. The yt matrix shows historical data on the industry average demand for workers which was  4,6 and 6  for managers,7, 7 and 9 for operators and 13,12 ,13 for engineers. Moreover, the unemployment is expected to be 10% for managers,  20% for operators and 4% for engineers in a year from now. Finally, after carrying out computations using the python software it has been determined that the number of workers expected to be needed ina year from now are 4 managers, 7 operators and 12 engineers. 

Given that the number of available workers is expected to be 1 manager, 1 engineer and 1 operator and however, the number of workers needed are 4 managers, 12 egineers and 7 operators there would be a labor mismatch:  a shortage of 3 managers, 11 engineers and 6 operators. Then, an upsizing strategy would be needed to avoid the labor mismatch being hiring the most suitable strategy given that the shortage of workers is quite considerable.
